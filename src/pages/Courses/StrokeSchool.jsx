                        Our Stroke School program is an essential part of every swimmer’s journey to 
                        become a well-rounded, proficient swimmer. In Stroke School practices, we are 
                        teaching the sport of swimming, not just swimming up and down the pool. 
                        Our Coaches take the time to teach swimmers the fundamentals of competitive 
                        swimming while building a love for the sport through fun, engaging learning. 
                        We teach, develop, and improve Freestyle, Backstroke, Breaststroke, Butterfly, 
                        competitive skills like diving, flip turns, and touch turns, and focus on teaching 
                        swimming etiquette and racing strategy. The small-group atmosphere in our Stroke School 
                        Levels mean that our Coaches pay attention to every detail to help your swimmer become 
                        the best they can be.
