                While our core group swim classes are small, 
                our private and semi-private swimming classes provide a more personalized experience. 
                Private lessons are 60 minutes long and pair one swimmer with one instructor. Semi-private 
                lessons also last 60 minutes, but two swimmers can join the same lesson, which makes these lessons 
                a wonderful fit for siblings or friends who want to swim together. </p>
